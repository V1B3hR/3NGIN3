- **Optimization Strategy Training**: Progressive difficulty training across complexity levels
- **Collaborative Learning Training**: Diverse agent pair training scenarios
- **Meta-Learning Integration**: Cross-dimensional learning pattern extraction

**Learning Mechanisms:**
- Cross-mode performance learning
- Adaptive strategy selection based on problem complexity
- Agent style evolution through collaborative experience
- Pattern recognition and application across training sessions

### 3. Assessment and Reporting (`assessment_report.py`)

**Comprehensive Analysis:**
- Pre-training vs post-training comparison
- Component-wise improvement tracking
- Training effectiveness evaluation
- Future recommendations generation

## Results Summary
