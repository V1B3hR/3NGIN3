## Detailed Test Results

### 1. Core Engine Tests (ThreeDimensionalHRO)

**Status:** ✅ PASSED  
**Test Method:** Main demonstration script execution

#### X-Axis Reasoning Modes
- **Sequential Reasoning:** ✅ Working (Confidence: 0.87, Execution time: 0.000s)
- **Neural Reasoning:** ✅ Working (Confidence: 0.06, Pattern matches: 7, Context strength: 2.71)
- **Hybrid Reasoning:** ✅ Working (Confidence: 0.43, Fusion weight: 0.60)

**Analysis:** All three reasoning modes are operational. Neural mode shows expected lower confidence due to simulation nature, while sequential mode shows high confidence as expected for logical reasoning.
