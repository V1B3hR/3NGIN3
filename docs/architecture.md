# 3NGIN3 Architecture Overview

## Three Axes of Cognition

- **X-Axis: Reasoning Mode**  
  - Sequential: Symbolic, step-by-step logic.
  - Neural: Neural pattern recognition (torch-powered).
  - Hybrid: Weighted blend for nuanced problem-solving.

- **Y-Axis: Compute Backend**  
  - Local: Standard execution.
  - Distributed (Simulated): Blueprint for network scaling.
  - Quantum (Simulated): Simulated annealing for QUBO optimization.

- **Z-Axis: Optimization Strategy**  
  - Simple: Randomized search.
  - Complex: Quantum-inspired deep search.
  - Adaptive: Selects best approach per problem.

## DuetMind Layer

Mirrored agent self-play, style vectors, cognitive diversity.

## Safety Mechanisms

- **Cognitive RCD:** Monitors intent vs. outcome, halts unsafe execution.

## Thread-Safe State

- Atomic updates, rollback on error, ready for concurrency.

## Extensibility

- Modular, single-file prototype
- Easily extendable for new axes, backends, or reasoning modes
