# 3NGIN3 Demo Output & Interpretation

## Initialization
- Engine started at: (sequential, local, simple)
- Neural capabilities: enabled/minimal
- Safety monitoring: active

## X-Axis Reasoning
- Sequential, neural, hybrid reasoning tested.
- Outputs: confidence, logical steps, fusion weights.

## Y-Axis Compute Backend
- Initial mode: local.
- For full demonstration, cycle through distributed, quantum (simulated) and note differences.

## Z-Axis Optimization
- Simple, complex, adaptive strategies tested.
- Metrics: best score, quantum-inspired details, adaptive choices.

## DuetMind Dialogue
- Two agents collaborate on a creative design challenge.
- Outputs: dialogue quality, insights, cognitive diversity.

## Safety Mechanisms
- Resource and ethics tests performed.
- RCD status reported.

## Final Report
- Summarizes engine configuration, demonstration metrics, and future capabilities.

## Interpretation
- All axes demonstrated (if Y-Axis cycling implemented).
- Next steps: Documentation, performance improvement, feature extension.
