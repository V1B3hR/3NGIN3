"""
Template for synthetic graph data generation.

Tasks:
- Generate graphs with node features and adjacency matrix.
- Create clear communities (clusters), shortest path scenarios.
- Output: node features (numpy array), adjacency matrix (numpy array).
- Challenge: Can the system recognize graph data and (later) apply GNN modules?

Dependencies: numpy, networkx (recommended for graph ops).
