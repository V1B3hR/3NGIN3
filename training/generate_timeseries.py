"""
Template for synthetic time series data generation.

Tasks:
- Generate sequences with trends, seasonality, and anomalies.
- Output: numpy arrays (e.g., shape (1000, 50, 1) for 1000 samples, 50 timesteps).
- Challenge: Can the system identify temporal patterns and anomalies?

Dependencies: numpy, pandas (optional for DataFrame output).
