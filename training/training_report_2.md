Technical Implementation
The pipeline validates the 3NGIN3 architecture's core thesis that different cognitive tasks require different reasoning approaches. The meta-controller successfully routes:

Tabular data with clear rules → Sequential reasoning
Image data requiring pattern detection → Neural reasoning
Complex multi-feature problems → Hybrid reasoning
This demonstrates true cognitive adaptability rather than a one-size-fits-all approach, fulfilling the original vision of a three-dimensional reasoning engine that adapts its methodology to the task at hand.
